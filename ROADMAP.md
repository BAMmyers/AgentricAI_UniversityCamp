# AgentricAI University - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the conceptual development phases of the AgentricAI platform, from initial architecture to future vision.

---

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Architecture (Complete)

*   **Objective:** Establish a robust, scalable foundation for the entire application.
*   **Key Milestones:**
    *   [x] **UI Framework:** Implement React with TypeScript for a type-safe, component-based architecture.
    *   [x] **Global State Management:** Set up a centralized `AppContext` using `useReducer` to manage all application state.
    *   [x] **Role-Based Portals:** Create the initial structures for Admin, Parent/Teacher, and Student portals.
    *   [x] **Initial Agent Manifest:** Define the initial roster of AI agents and their roles in `agentManifest.ts`.
    *   [x] **Visual Studio MVP:** Develop the core node-based workflow editor (`Studio.tsx`) with basic node creation and connection logic.

### Phase 2: Agent Activation & Core Logic (Complete)

*   **Objective:** Breathe life into the core agents and implement the primary user journeys.
*   **Key Milestones:**
    *   [x] **Secure Authentication:** Implement a universal, password-based login system for all roles, replacing the demo login.
    *   [x] **Security Sentinel Integration:** Activate the `Security_Sentinel_001` and `Logger_001` agents to monitor and log all authentication events. Create the **Security Sentinel Console** for admins.
    *   [x] **Companion Agent Logic:** Implement the `useCompanionAgentLogic` hook to give student companion agents autonomy in creating and adapting schedules.
    *   [x] **Live Mission Command:** Activate `Orchestrator Alpha` in the new **Mission Command** view, enabling live, multi-agent mission planning and execution based on admin objectives.
    *   [x] **Recursive Code Assistant:** Integrate the AI chat widget with the ability to read the app's codebase and propose live code modifications.

### Phase 3: Resilience, Polish & Finalization (Complete)

*   **Objective:** Harden the application against errors, refine the user experience, and finalize the core agent collaborations.
*   **Key Milestones:**
    *   [x] **"Bug" Agent Activation:** Implement the `ErrorBoundary` and `SystemStatusBar` to gracefully handle UI errors without crashing the application.
    *   [x] **"Medic" & "Mechanic" Agent Integration:** Add the System Integrity Scan to the `SystemOptimizationView`, allowing admins to command the `Medic` agent to perform security checks and log results to the Sentinel Console.
    *   [x] **Global Notification System:** Implement the "toast" notification system for non-intrusive user feedback.
    *   [x] **UI/UX Polish:** Refine visual feedback across the application, including enhanced execution logs and interactive elements.
    *   [x] **Project Documentation:** Create core project files (`README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `.gitignore`, etc.) to ensure project health and maintainability.

### Phase 4: Future Enhancements (Vision)

*   **Objective:** Expand the platform's capabilities to push the boundaries of AI-driven education.
*   **Planned Features:**
    *   [ ] **Advanced AAC Device Integration:** Deepen integration with hardware-level APIs for augmentative and alternative communication devices.
    *   [ ] **Real-time Collaboration in Studio:** Allow multiple administrators to build workflows together in the AI Studio.
    *   [ ] **Expanded Tool Library:** Integrate more external tools and APIs for agents to use (e.g., live data sources, code execution environments).
    *   [ ] **Quantum Agent Simulation:** Develop a dedicated view to simulate and visualize the theoretical workflows of the Quantum Studies agent roster.
    *   [ ] **Persistent Core Memory:** Implement a true database backend to allow agents to build and retain long-term memory across sessions.
