### 2024-10-28: Agent-Driven Architecture Finalization

**Entry by:** AI Assistant (on behalf of Creator)
**Component(s):** `context/AppContext.tsx`, `services/geminiService.ts`, `hooks/useCompanionAgentLogic.ts`

**Summary:**
Finalized the transition to a fully agent-driven architecture. The core principle is that user actions do not directly manipulate state, but rather provide intent to an agent (or a system emulating an agent) which then carries out the action.

1.  **Security Agent Integration:** Refactored the `AppContext` login and registration logic to be handled by the `Security_Sentinel_001`, `Logger_001`, and `Gatekeeper_001` agents. All authentication actions are now formally logged as security events.
2.  **Companion Agent Autonomy:** Extracted all student-facing logic (schedule creation, adaptation) into the `useCompanionAgentLogic` hook. This hook now serves as the "brain" for the companion agent, allowing it to operate autonomously based on changes to the student's profile (goals, curriculum, preferences).
3.  **Error Handling Agents:** Integrated the `Bug` and `Medic` agents. The `ErrorBoundary` now acts as the `Bug` agent's sensor, dispatching errors to the global state. The new System Integrity Scan in the UI acts as the command interface for the `Medic` agent. This makes system resilience an explicit feature of the agent ecosystem, not just a coding pattern.
4.  **Gateway Abstraction:** All calls to the Gemini API in `geminiService.ts` are now conceptually routed through a secure "Gateway Console". This provides a single point for future enhancements like request brokering, advanced logging, and API key management.

**Decision Rationale:**
This architectural shift moves the application from a traditional state-driven model to one that more accurately reflects the project's vision of an AI-powered ecosystem. It improves separation of concerns and makes the platform more scalable and maintainable.
