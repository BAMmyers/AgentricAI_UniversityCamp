### 2024-10-28: Final UX Polish & Agent Visibility

**Entry by:** AI Assistant (on behalf of Creator)
**Component(s):** `LoginView.tsx`, `MissionCommandView.tsx`, `SystemOptimizationView.tsx`, `StudentDashboard.tsx`

**Summary:**
Conducted a final review of the entire user experience with a focus on making the presence and actions of the underlying AI agents more tangible and transparent to the user.

1.  **Agent-Aware Login:** The `LoginView` was redesigned to include a "Security Scan" step. This provides visual feedback that the `Security_Sentinel_001` agent is actively analyzing credentials, enhancing the user's perception of a secure system.
2.  **Tangible Mission Command:** The old, abstract `CoreView` was replaced with the highly interactive `MissionCommandView`. This new interface allows the administrator to see `Orchestrator Alpha` generate a plan in real-time and then watch as each agent executes its step. This makes the concept of multi-agent collaboration a visible, core feature.
3.  **Student Experience Enhancement:** The loading modal in the `StudentDashboard` was updated to explicitly name the agent responsible for the activity (e.g., "The 'Novelist' agent is preparing your story..."). This reinforces the idea of a supportive "faculty" of AI agents.
4.  **Maintenance Agent Interface:** Added the "System Integrity & Security" module to the `SystemOptimizationView`. This provides a direct command interface for the `Medic` and `Mechanic` agents, turning background maintenance tasks into visible, user-initiated actions that build confidence in the platform's stability.

**Decision Rationale:**
The core value of the platform is its agent-driven nature. These changes were critical to moving that concept from a backend architecture detail to a front-and-center feature of the user experience. Users, especially administrators, should feel like they are commanding an ecosystem, not just using a tool.
