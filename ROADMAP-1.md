# AgentricAI Studios: Project Roadmap

## Vision

Our vision is to create an intuitive, powerful, and flexible open-source platform for AI experimentation and workflow automation, serving as the engine for the **[Echo Project](./ECHO_PROJECT.md)**.

This document outlines our planned features and development trajectory.

## üìç Near-Term Goals (Next 1-3 Months)

*Focus: Stability, Core User Experience, and Foundational Features.*

### Workflow Management
-   **[‚úîÔ∏è] Import/Export Workflows:** Implemented.
-   **[‚úîÔ∏è] Sandbox Mode for Unrestricted Experimentation:** Implemented. A private, ephemeral environment with an AI-driven review process for promoting new creations.
-   **[ ] Custom Agent Library UI:** Create a dedicated UI to view, manage, and delete custom agents that have been promoted from the sandbox.
-   **[ ] Connect Creator Workflows to Explorer UI:** Replace the static placeholder data in Explorer Mode with dynamic content generated by an agent workflow created in the Studio.

### UI/UX Enhancements
-   **[ ] Node Content Polish:** Improve how text and images are displayed within nodes.
-   **[ ] Advanced Error Handling:** Provide more context-aware error messages, with AI-powered suggestions.
-   **[ ] Edge Management:** Allow users to delete an edge without deleting the connected nodes.

### Documentation & Onboarding
-   **[ ] Agent Wiki:** Create a comprehensive `WIKI.md` detailing all core agents.
-   **[ ] In-App Guided Tour:** Develop a simple onboarding tour for new users.

## üéØ Mid-Term Goals (Next 3-6 Months)

*Focus: Expanding Capabilities and Workflow Complexity.*

### Advanced Workflow Control
-   **[ ] Conditional Logic Node (`If/Else`)**
-   **[ ] Iteration Node (`For Each`)**
-   **[ ] Streaming LLM Responses**

### Agent & LLM Enhancements

-   **[ ] LLM Configuration:** Allow users to configure advanced LLM parameters (e.g., `temperature`, `top_p`) on relevant nodes.
-   **[ ] Statefulness for Chat Agents:** Enable chat agents to maintain conversation history.

### Persistence & Performance
-   **[ ] Migration to IndexedDB:** Move from `localStorage` to `IndexedDB` for better performance with large workflows.
-   **[ ] Canvas Performance Optimization:** Improve rendering for a large number of nodes.
